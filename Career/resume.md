## Checklist

<ol>
<li><strong>Do you have a photo on your resume?</strong> Remove it.</li>
<li><strong>How many contact details and social profile links do you have on your resume?</strong> You should have no more than four. Do you need all of these?</li>
<li><strong>Do all the links work on your resume?</strong> Click through each of them.</li>
<li><strong>Do all the links point to professional pages on your resume?</strong> When you click through, will people see well-formatted, well-written content that conveys the type of work they can expect from you? Ensure this is the case also for your blog, GitHub, LinkedIn and any other links you provide.</li>
<li><strong>Is your resume easy to scan?</strong> Give your resume to a friend and ask them to take a look at it for 5 seconds, then tell you their immediate impression. Did they see key details? Did they think it’s too crowded? Or that it has too little information?</li>
<li><strong>Is your resume simple enough?</strong> Are you using any “fancy” designs? If so, is this kind of “fanciness” getting in the way of readability? If it’s not in the way of readability, that’s great. However, if it’s making things harder to scan, consider going with something more simple. Note that for frontend, UX or design-heavy positions, some nice flair can be a great touch.</li>
<li><strong>Is the resume concise and to the point?</strong> Are you using short sentences? Do you have bullet points with rarely more than two lines?</li>
<li><strong>Are you bolding too much?</strong> Aim to not bold anything inside a sentence, like in this one. Only bold important things like job title, company name, date, or headers.</li>
<li><strong>Is formatting consistent?</strong> Are you using standard font sizes, and aligning with tabs, over spacing things to be approximately close?</li>
<li><strong>Are you using internal company jargon?</strong> Do you have project names that only people inside the company would understand? If so, consider changing them to describing the project.</li>
<li><strong>Do you have a (spoken) languages or a references section?</strong> You can probably remove both of these.</li>
<li><strong>Do links stand out with a different color or formatting?</strong> They shouldn’t. They take away space and attention.</li>
</ol>

#### New Grad

Show a mastery of fundamental engineering skills

Then worry about the project management/leadership if there is room left
- management and leadership is VERY different in the real world, no one is going to put a new grad in charge of anything
- they are looking for someone who can master basic engineering tasks and can hold a basic conversation
- 

#### Dates

- Present > Current, Now
- "Full-Month – Full-Year"
  - **copy dash**^^^^^
- [Shorten properly](https://web.library.yale.edu/cataloging/months)

  - User error their time off wasn't approved

"solve x by doing y resulting in z"

### Projects

- Don't use the word "project"
- [Capitalize properly](https://cmodivapitalizemytitle.com/)
- Dont disclose "Personal Project", "Academic Project", or "Group Project"
- Projects should have bullet points, not paragraphs
- Order by relevance and impressiveness
- Impressive projects are
  - not school or tutorial projects
  - someone uses to solve a problem
  - has users
  - actively maintained
    - has active PRs

### Education

- Only include **extremely specialized** or **really cool** courses
- Dont include high school
- Dont include start dates
- "Bachelor of Science"

## Senior Engineers (10+ YoE)
