Bellman-Ford Algorithm is an algorithm that computes the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph
Although it is slower than Dijkstra's, it is more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(|E|)
Worst Case: O(|V||E|)
