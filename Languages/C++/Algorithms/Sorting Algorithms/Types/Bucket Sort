Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm

Time Complexity:
Best Case: Ω(n + k)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Average Case:Θ(n + k)
