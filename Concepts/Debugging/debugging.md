# Debugging

## Process

### Error Stack Trace

1. Use error stack trace to find error type, description, and location
2. Look at code and fix bug or move on to step 3
3. Look up bug on google or chatgpt

### No Error Stack Trace

1. Find the bug
2. Figure out what the expected output should be
3. Print out the output through the logic process to see where it fails
4. Fix the logic that is broken and go back to step 3
