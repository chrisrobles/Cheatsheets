# Asynchronous Programming

> Asynchronous operation is one that allows the computer to **move on** to other tasks while waiting for the operation to complete.

Time-consuming operations are made asynchronous so that the computer can execute other tasks while awaiting the completion of the original operation.

For example, you throw clothes in a laundry machine to get the process started. Then, while the clothes are washing you are free to do other chores.

Common time consuming web development operations made asynchronous are:
- network requests
- querying a database
