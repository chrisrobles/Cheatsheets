## Address

Each byte in RAM has an address

Data can take up more than one address depending on the size of the data type
- int
  - 4 bytes
- char
  - 1 byte

When finding the next value in RAM, the address is incremented by the size of the data type.
- ex. first int at `$0` and the next int at `$4`

`0x00` beginning address in hex

## Bit

1's and 0's

## Byte

1 byte = 8 bits

## Hexadecimal

`0xA3`

1 hex = 4 bits

2 hex = 8 bits = 1 byte
